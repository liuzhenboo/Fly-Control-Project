Support for the FDC toolbox
===========================
If you have any questions about the FDC toolbox, contact the author at the
address given below. But read the .TXT files and the FAQ and Known Problems
pages on the FDC website first; they already provide answers to many
questions. Also, do not forget to check the user-manual; see the FDC home-
page for more information (address given below).

Support by telephone is not possible. I can give no guarantees with regard
to the user-support, except that I will do my very best to find answers to
your questions. No guarantees with regard to present and future support of
the FDC package can be given.


Reporting bugs
==============
If you find a bug please contact the author so that it can be corrected.
Please include information about the Matlab/Simulink version and the machine
type on which the programs were run. If an error occurs with customized
versions of the FDC tools or systems, please send a diskette containing the
appropriate files, or attach those files to your e-mail message. Suggestions
for bug-fixes are very much appreciated.


FDC enhancements
================
You are free to enhance the software from the FDC toolbox and/or modify
the existing source codes, as long as you don't violate the licence rules
in LICENSE.TXT. I am very interested in such improvements and additions to
the FDC tools and models an I would appreciate it if you keep me informed.
If you think your own developments are useful for all FDC users, please
send me a copy. Maybe I can implement your tools and models in new versions
of the FDC toolbox.

It is recommended to publish any enhancements for the toolbox under the
Dutchroll Open Source Software License (DOSSL) version 1.0, the terms of
which can be found in LICENSE.TXT, especially if you want me to include
your enhancements. Notice the 'copyleft' character of the DOSSL: any
derivative works may be distributed only if they remain available under the
terms of DOSSL 1.0!

Of course, any suggestions for future developments with regard to the FDC
toolbox are very welcome.
