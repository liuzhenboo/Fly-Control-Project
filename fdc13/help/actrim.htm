<H2>Aircraft trim program <I><FONT FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">ACTRIM</FONT></I></H2>

<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">ACTRIM</FONT></I> is a M<SMALL>ATLAB</SMALL> program, which can be applied to S<SMALL>IMULINK</SMALL> implementations of non-linear aircraft models in order to determine steady-state trimmed-flight conditions. <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">ACTRIM</FONT></I> has been written for the S<SMALL>IMULINK</SMALL> system <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="beaver.htm">Beaver</A></FONT></I>, which can be opened by typing <CODE>beaver</CODE> at the M<SMALL>ATLAB</SMALL> command line. The trim routine can be applied to other aircraft models in S<SMALL>IMULINK</SMALL> if they use exactly the same  definitions of the input and state vectors as the system <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Beaver</FONT></I>. However, if this is not the case, it is relatively easy to adapt the source code <SMALL>ACTRIM.M</SMALL> for the new situation (it is recommended to take a closer look at that source-code to see how it works). It is planned to futher standardize the representation of non-linear aircraft models in S<SMALL>IMULINK</SMALL> in future versions of FDC, which will make <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">ACTRIM</FONT></I> more general as well.
