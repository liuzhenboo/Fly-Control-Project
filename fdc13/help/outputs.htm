<H2>List of output signals from the system <I><FONT FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Beaver</FONT></I></H2>

The system <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="beaver.htm">Beaver</A></FONT></I> contains the non-linear dynamic model of the DHC-2 'Beaver' aircraft, which consists of twelve state equations, forces and moment equations, airdata equations, and many additional output equations. <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Beaver</FONT></I> is a graphical S<SMALL>IMULINK</SMALL> block-diagram.

<H2>S-function in/outputs vs. in/outputs sent to the M<SMALL>ATLAB</SMALL> workspace</H2>

It is important to notice that the number of outputs which are sent to the M<SMALL>ATLAB</SMALL> workspace by means of <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">To Workspace</FONT></I> blocks is considerably larger than the number of <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Outport</FONT></I> blocks, representing 'S-function outputs' of the system <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Beaver</FONT></I>. The <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Outport</FONT></I> blocks are needed for connecting other systems to the output-side of the system <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Beaver</FONT></I>, e.g., systems with models of sensor dynamics, controllers, etc. Unfortunately, S<SMALL>IMULINK</SMALL> does not accept vector outputs to be connected to <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Outport</FONT></I> blocks within the first level of a graphical system; therefore, only a small subset of the output variables from <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Beaver</FONT></I> have actually been connected to the <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Outport</FONT></I> blocks.<BR><BR>

By default, the sixteen outputs which were needed to simulate the 'Beaver' autopilot are connected to <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Outport</FONT></I> blocks. If other output signals are needed by systems which ought to be connected to <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Beaver</FONT></I>, it is necessary to add more <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Outport</FONT></I> blocks to this list of 'S-function outputs'. For instance: if you want to examine control laws which use accelerations as reference signals, these signals must be connected to new <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Outport</FONT></I> blocks in the first level of <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Beaver</FONT></I>. Currently, the accelerations are send to the M<SMALL>ATLAB</SMALL> workspace only, but they cannot yet be used as inputs to other S<SMALL>IMULINK</SMALL> systems, connected to the output side of the system <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Beaver</FONT></I>.<BR><BR>

Currently, it is not possible to send complete vectors through individual <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Inport</FONT></I> and <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Outport</FONT></I> blocks in the first level of a graphical system (where they serve to connect the graphical system to other S<SMALL>IMULINK</SMALL> systems, or to provide access to the system for analytical tools such as trim and linearization routines). <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Inport</FONT></I> and <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Outport</FONT></I> blocks in the first level of graphical S<SMALL>IMULINK</SMALL> systems only accept <I>scalar</I> signals, which is really a serious limitation of S<SMALL>IMULINK</SMALL>! Hopefully, this problem will be solved in future S<SMALL>IMULINK</SMALL> versions!

<H3>S-function outputs
</H3>
The system <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Beaver</FONT></I> can be treated as a <I>black-box</I> model, which needs to be accessed through its input and output ports only. <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Beaver</FONT></I> currently contains sixteen <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Outport</FONT></I> blocks in the first level of its graphical block-diagram. These sixteen 'S-function outputs' form a subset of the 89 outputs which are sent to the M<SMALL>ATLAB</SMALL> workspace (<A HREF="#outputlist">see below</A>). By default, these sixteen outputs are:
<PRE>  V, alpha, beta, p, q, r, psi, theta, phi, xe, ye, H
  Hdot
  pb/2V, qc/V, rb/2V
</PRE>
i.e., the states, rate of climb, and the dimensionless rotational speeds, in that particular order. These variables are needed for simulations of the 'Beaver' autopilot, including the linear state-space models of the dynamics of the control surfaces, steering column/wheel, cables, and actuators. Other sets of 'S-function outputs' can be implemented only by editing the system <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Beaver</FONT></I> according to your own wishes. <BR><BR>

See the description of the first level in the block-diagram of the system Beaver (here denoted as <A HREF="level1.htm">Level 1</A>) for more information about the I/O structure of this system.

<A NAME= "outputlist"><H3>Outputs which are stored in the M<SMALL>ATLAB</SMALL> workspace</H3>
</A>
During simulations, the time-trajectories of <I>all</I> available output signals are sent to the matrix <I>Out</I> in the M<SMALL>ATLAB</SMALL> workspace. The columns of this matrix contain the time-trajectories of these outputs, numbered as follows:
<PRE>

The names of the masked subsystem blocks in which these outputs are calculated have been put between accolades. The numbers of the corresponding columns in the outputmatrix <I>Out</I> have been put between round brackets. After finishing a simulation, the time-trajectories, stored in the matrix <I>Out</I> can be plotted against the time-axis which is stored in the vector <I>time</I>. For instance, if you want to plot the <I>n</I><SUP>th</SUP> column of <I>Out</I>, the plot-command looks like:
<PRE>   plot(time,Out(:,n))
</PRE>
where 1 &#60;&#61; <I>n</I> &#60;&#61; 89. The appropriate value of <I>n</I> can be retrieved from the list above. It is important to notice that this list represents the default definition of <I>Out</I>, used in the system <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Beaver</FONT></I>. You may wish to add more outputs, or delete unwanted outputs from this list, by adding and/or deleting blocks to/from the system. In that case, this list is not valid anymore.

<H3>Using the Matlab-macro <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">RESULTS</FONT></I></H3>

If you want to plot simulation results by directly using the matrix <I>Out</I>, as demonstrated above, you need to know the column numbers of the different outputs. However, if your system uses the same definitions of the matrices <I>In</I> (see the list of <A HREF="inputs.htm">inputsignals</A>) and <I>Out</I> as the system <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Beaver</FONT></I>, it is also possible to run <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="results.htm">RESULTS</A></FONT></I> before plotting the results, in order to get separate time-trajectories of all input and output variables with self-explaining variable names. If you run <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">RESULTS</FONT></I>, the following <I>output</I>variables will be created in the M<SMALL>ATLAB</SMALL> workspace:
