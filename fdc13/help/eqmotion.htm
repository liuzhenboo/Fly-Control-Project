<H2>Subsystem <I><FONT FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Aircraft Equations of Motion (Beaver)</FONT></I>
</H2>

The dynamics of a rigid aircraft can be expressed by twelve Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The equations which determine the magnitude of the time-derivatives of the twelve state variables as a function of the external forces and moments, external disturbances, and the states themselves, have been gathered in the subsystem <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Aircraft Equations of Motion (Beaver)</FONT></I> of the system <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="beaver.htm">Beaver</A></FONT></I>. This subsystem also contains the integrator which obtains the states from their time-derivatives.<BR><BR>

The twelve ODEs themselves are independent of the aircraft considered. However, some of the aerodynamic forces or moments may depend upon the time-derivatives of the state variables, which make the differential equations implicit. It depends upon the resulting implicit expressions whether or not S<SMALL>IMULINK</SMALL> can cope with them. Often, it is not difficult to rewrite the implicit differential equation(s) in terms of a set generalized explicit ODEs and a separate aircraft-dependent correction term. For the system <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Beaver</FONT></I>, such an aircraft-dependent correction term proved to be necessary. It has been included in <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="xdotcorr.htm">xdotcorr</A></FONT></I> - one of the masked subsystem blocks from the subsystem <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Aircraft Equations of Motion (Beaver)</FONT></I>. This explains why the extension <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">(Beaver)</FONT></I> has been included in the subsystem name.
<BR><BR>

<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Aircraft Equations of Motion (Beaver)</FONT></I> contains the following blocks:

<UL>
<LI>The masked subsystem block <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="xdotcorr.htm">xdotcorr (Beaver)</A></FONT></I> contains the aircraft-dependent corrections to the state equations for the DHC-2 'Beaver' aircraft, which were induced when converting the original implicit differential equations into a set of explicit ODEs.

<LI>The masked subsystem <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="uvw.htm">uvw</A></FONT></I> contains the transformation equations which make it possible to obtain the components of the true airspeed along the body-axes of the aircraft, given the true airspeed, angle of attack, and sideslip angle.

<LI>An <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Integrator</FONT></I> block is used to obtain the time-trajectories of the state variables themselves from their derivatives with respect to time.

<LI>The <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Gain </FONT></I>block <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="xfix.htm">XFIX</A></FONT></I> makes it possible to artificially fix states, by performing an element-by-element multiplication of the vector <I>xdot</I> with the vector <I>xfix</I>. All elements of <I>xfix</I> either equal one or zero, meaning that the corresponding states are either free to vary or artificially kept constant. The vector <I>xfix</I> can be set manually or defined by means of the utility <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="fixstate.htm">FIXSTATE</A></FONT></I>. Its default value will be set by <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="loader.htm">LOADER</A></FONT></I>, if the vector <I>xfix</I> can not be found in the M<SMALL>atlab</SMALL> workspace.<BR>

<LI>The subsystem <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="12odes.htm">12 ODEs</A></FONT></I> contains the twelve ODEs themselves.
</UL>

<H3>Computation order
</H3>

First, the velocity components <I>u</I>, <I>v</I>, and <I>w</I> are computed, using the current value of the state vector <I>x</I>, and the outputvector <I>yhlp</I> from the masked subsystem <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="hlpfcn.htm">Hlpfcn</A></FONT></I> (this vector contains frequently used sines and cosines of angular state variables). The velocity components <I>u</I>, <I>v</I>, and <I>w</I> are needed for solving the differential equations concerning the aircraft-coordinates <I>x<SUB>e</SUB></I> and <I>y<SUB>e</SUB></I>. In order to account for contributions of non-steady atmosphere, the velocity components due to wind and/or atmospheric turbulence, <I>u<SUB>w</SUB></I>, <I>v<SUB>w</SUB></I>, and <I>w<SUB>w</SUB></I>, are extracted from the vector <I>uwind</I>, and added to <I>u</I>, <I>v</I>, and <I>w</I>. Next, the time-derivatives of the states are computed in the subsystem <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="12odes.htm">12 ODEs</A></FONT></I>, which uses the current state vector <I>x</I>, the helpvector <I>yhlp</I>, the vectors <I>Ftot</I> and <I>Mtot</I> (containing the total forces and moments), and the vector [<I>u</I>+<I>u<SUB>w</SUB></I>, <I>v</I>+<I>v<SUB>w</SUB></I>, <I>w</I>+<I>w<SUB>w</SUB></I>]<SUP><I>T</I></SUP> as inputs.
<BR><BR>

The time-derivatives of the states are gathered in the vector <I>xdot</I> = <I>dx/dt</I>. As said before, the vector <I>xdot</I> that leaves the subsystem <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">12 ODEs</FONT></I> needs to be corrected for aircraft-dependent terms. This is done in the subsystem <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="xdotcorr.htm">xdotcorr (Beaver)</A></FONT></I>, which needs the current state vector <I>x</I>, and, in the case of the 'Beaver' aircraft, the outputvector from the masked subsystem <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="atmosph.htm">Atmosph</A></FONT></I> in the subsystem <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="adgrp.htm">Airdata Group</A></FONT></I> (to be more specific: <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">xdotcorr</FONT></I> needs to know the air-density for the correction of the beta-dot equation). The outputvector from <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">xdotcorr</FONT></I>, the corrected version of <I>xdot</I>, is send to the gain <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="xfix.htm">XFIX</A></FONT></I>, which is used to artificially fix states if required by the user. Finally, the time-derivatives are sent to the <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Integrator</FONT></I> block, where they are integrated to obtain the updated value of the state vector <I>x</I>. Note: the <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Integrator</FONT></I> block uses the vector <I>xinco</I> as initial condition (see below).
<BR><BR>

The state vector <I>x</I> is fed back to the other subsystems in <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="beaver.htm">Beaver</A></FONT></I>, and also internally in the subsystem <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Aircraft Equations of Motion</FONT></I>, because the time-derivatives of the state variables depend upon the state variables themselves. The second level of <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Beaver</FONT></I> contains a masked subsystem block <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="hlpfcn.htm">Hlpfcn</A></FONT></I>, which computes the sines and cosines of the angles <I>alpha</I>, <I>beta</I>, <I>psi</I>, <I>theta</I>, and <I>phi</I>. These 'helpvariables' are also fed back to other subsystems in <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Beaver</FONT></I>, including <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Aircraft Equations of Motion</FONT></I>. The resulting feedback loops can be distinguished from the other signals by their magenta foreground color (see also the <A HREF="colors.htm">color definitions</A>).

<H3>Parameters which must be defined in the M<SMALL>ATLAB</SMALL> workspace
</H3>

<UL>
<LI><I>xinco</I>: Initial value of the state vector <I>x</I>. Usually, a steady-state trimmed-flight condition is used as initial condition for the aircraft ('condition' = combination of input variables and state vector, so <I>xinco</I> does not specify a complete initial flight condition by itself!). Trimmed-flight conditions can be computed with the trim-routine <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="actrim.htm">ACTRIM</A></FONT></I>.
Initial conditions can also be retrieved from file by means of the M<SMALL>ATLAB</SMALL> utility <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="incoload.htm">INCOLOAD</A></FONT></I>. <LI>The block <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">Integrator</FONT></I> specifies <I>xinco</I> as initial value of the state vector.
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>xfix</I>: Vector with twelve elements (<I>length(xfix) = length(x)</I>) which are all equal to either one or zero. If the <I>n<SUP>th</SUP></I> element of <I>xfix</I> is equal to one, the corresponding element of <I>x</I> (= the corresponding state variable) may vary freely, according to the 'actual' solution of the state equations. If the <I>n<SUP>th</SUP></I> element of xfix is equal to zero, the corresponding state is <I>artificially</I> fixed to its initial value, no matter what its actual value should be. This may be useful for the analysis of some types of aircraft responses. The vector <I>xfix</I> can be defined manually, or by running <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="fixstate.htm">FIXSTATE</A></FONT></I> before starting a new simulation. Usually, <I>xfix = 1</I> or <I>xfix = ones(1,12)</I> will be used for simulations. This default value will be set automatically if you run <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="loader.htm">LOADER</A></FONT></I> before starting a new simulation.
<BR><BR>

<LI><I>GM1</I>: Matrix which contains some basic geometric properties of the aircraft, and its mass. <I>GM1</I> is needed by the subsystem <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="12odes.htm">12 ODEs</A></FONT></I>.
