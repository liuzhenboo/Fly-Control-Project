<H2>The radio-navigation block <I><FONT FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">VOR (Nominal VOR signals)</FONT></I></H2>

The masked subsystem block <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">VOR</FONT></I>, from the VOR sublibrary of the <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="navlib.htm">NAVLIB</A></FONT></I> block-library, calculates VOR signals which an aircraft receives when it flies at a certain position with respect to a certain user-specified reference VOR bearing. The coordinates of the VOR antenna, measured relatively to the Earth-bounded reference frame, must be defined by the user for <I>t</I> = 0. See the <A HREF="#References">references</A> below for more information.<BR><BR>

<B>Note:</B> the block VOR determines the nominal VOR signals, without taking into account noise and/or steady-state errors. For the latter kind of errors in the VOR signal, a separate block <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="vorerr.htm">VORerr</A></FONT></I> has been created. The system <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="vorxmpl.htm">VOR example</A></FONT></I> demonstrates how these blocks can be combined.

<H3>Inputsignals: <I>uvor1</I> and <I>uvor2</I></H3>
<PRE> uvor1 = [xe ye H]',
 uvor2 = psi.

 xe : X-coordinate of aircraft in Earth-fixed reference frame [m]
 ye : Y-coordinate of aircraft in Earth-fixed reference frame [m]
 H  : altitude of aircraft above sea level [m]
 psi: heading of the aircraft (yaw angle) [rad]
</PRE>
<B>Note:</B> these signals are outputs from the non-linear aircraft dynamics model (e.g. from the system <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="beaver.htm">Beaver</A></FONT></I>).

<H3>Outputsignals: <I>yvor1</I>, <I>yvor2</I>, and <I>yvor3</I></H3>
<PRE> yvor1 = Gamma_VOR: Angle between chosen VOR-bearing and line
                    from aircraft's c.g. to VOR antenna [rad]
 yvor2 = R_VOR    : 2D-distance from origin Earth-fixed reference
                    frame to VOR (as seen from above) [m]

 yvor3 = [Cone-of-silence-flag, Range-flag]'.
 yvor4 = ToFrom
</PRE>
The Cone-of-silence-flag is set to 1 if the aircraft enters the 'cone of silence'. The Range-flag is set to 1 if the aircraft flies outside the area where the VOR signals can be received with appropriate reliability.<BR><BR>

The variable <I>ToFrom</I> is set to 1 if aircraft is flying towards the VOR antenna or 0 if the aircraft flies away from the antenna.
