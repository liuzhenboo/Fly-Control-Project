% The FDC toolbox - Help texts for the FDC models and tools.
% ==========================================================
% The directory HELP is used to gather all help texts for the Simulink
% models and tools from the FDC toolbox. There are two types of help-
% files: *.HLP and *.HTM. The first type has been maintained only for
% compatibility reasons with FDC 1.2. Those help-texts can be displayed
% by typing:
%
%    type <blockname>.hlp
%
% at the Matlab command line. Blockname is the name of the graphical
% Simulink block (e.g. type accel.hlp). Many help texts are larger than
% the command window, so you may have to use the slider bars on the right
% hand side of the window (or use the PgUp/PgDn keys).
%
% *.HLP files for some of the the Matlab programs from the FDC toolbox are
% also included in the directory HELP, but these programs also have quite
% extensive built-in help which can be displayed by typing:
%
%    help <program>
%
% (e.g. help actrim). It is highly recommended to view the source-codes
% of those Matlab routines too; they also have been thorougly documented.
%
% The second type contains formatted help-texts in HTML format, which
% can be viewed with a web browser (best read with Microsoft Internet
% Explorer 3.0 or newer). These files can be displayed by typing:
%
%    fdchelp <blockname>
%
% at the Matlab command line. Here, <blockname> is the name of a
% graphical block or Matlab routine. Normally this will open your web-
% browser and display the help-text, but if you use a non-standard
% web-browser or a new program like Netscape Communicator 4.0, it may
% be necessary to open your browser yourself before typing the FDCHELP
% command.
%
% In graphical Simulink systems, double-clicking a blue title-block with
% shadow border will automatically open your web-browser and list the
% appropriate help text. Here too, it may be necessary to open your
% browser before trying to view the help-text.
%
% An overview of all HTML helpfiles can be shown by opening the file
% INDEX.HTM from the HELP subdirectory in your web-browser.
