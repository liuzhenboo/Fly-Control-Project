<H2>Subsystem <I><FONT FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">xdotcorr (Beaver)</FONT></I>
</H2>

<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">xdotcorr (Beaver)</FONT></I> is a masked S<SMALL>IMULINK</SMALL> subsystem, which is contained in the subsystem <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="eqmotion.htm">Aircraft Equations of Motion (Beaver)</A></FONT></I> of the S-function <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="beaver.htm">Beaver</A></FONT></I>. <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">xdotcorr</FONT></I> is the only aircraft-dependent block of this subsystem. In this case it depends upon the aerodynamic model of the DHC-2 'Beaver' from <A HREF="#Tjee&Mulder">ref.[1]</A>. It is used to convert implicit state equations of the 'Beaver' dynamic model into explicit state equations. The implicitness of the original model equations is caused by a contribution of the time-derivative of beta-dot to the aerodynamic sideforce. Since S<SMALL>IMULINK</SMALL> can not always cope with implicit ODEs, the ODEs were divided in an aircraft-independent part and a separate correction term. It is this correction term which has been implemented in <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">xdotcorr (Beaver)</FONT></I>.
<BR><BR>

<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">xdotcorr</FONT></I> can be adapted for other aircraft models, in cases where it is necessary to bring into account contributions of time-derivatives of states to the aerodynamic forces and/or moments, which would otherwise result in implicit state equations. Such implicit state equations most often involve alpha-dot and beta-dot terms.
