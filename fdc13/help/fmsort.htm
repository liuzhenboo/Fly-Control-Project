<H2>Subsystem <I><FONT FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">FMsort</FONT></I></H2>

<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">FMsort</FONT></I> is a subsystem of the system <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="beaver.htm">Beaver</A></FONT></I>, used to sort the different contributions to the external forces and moments which act upon the aircraft and to compute the total external forces and moments in the body-axes reference frame by summing the different contributions. Note: the aerodynamic forces and moments for the DHC-2 'Beaver' are expressed in the body-axes reference frame in stead of the more common wind or flight-path axes. If aerodynamic lift and drag are used in stead, it is necessary to implement the transformation equations in the equations for <I>dV/dt</I>, <I>d(alpha)/dt</I>, and <I>d(beta)/dt</I> and to change <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">FMsort</FONT></I> accordingly.

Currently, only four contributions to the external forces and moments, acting upon the aircraft, are taken into account: the <A HREF="aerogrp.htm">aerodynamic forces and moments</A>, <A HREF="enggrp.htm">propulsive forces and moments</A> (including slipstream effects), forces due to the influence of <A HREF="gravity.htm">gravity</A>, and additional <A HREF="fwind.htm">contributions due to non-steady atmosphere</A>. It is not difficult to add more contributions to this list: just unmask the block <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">FMsort</FONT></I> to find out how it works.
