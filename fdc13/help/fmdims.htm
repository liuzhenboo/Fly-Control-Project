<H2>Subsystem <I><FONT FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">FMdims</FONT></I></H2>

<I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">FMdims</FONT></I> is a masked S<SMALL>IMULINK</SMALL> subsystem, used to compute forces in [<I>N</I>] and moments in [<I>Nm</I>] from dimensionless force and moment coefficients, using the dynamic pressure and some geometric properties of the aircraft, see the <A HREF="#Equations">equations</A> below. In the 'Beaver' model, <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">FMdims</FONT></I> is used in the subsystem blocks <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="aerogrp.htm">Aerodynamics Group (Beaver)</A></FONT></I> and <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="enggrp.htm">Engine Group (Beaver)</A></FONT></I> of the system <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="beaver.htm">Beaver</A></FONT></I>, where it is being applied to aerodynamic forces and moments and propulsive forces and moments, respectively. (In those subsystems, the non-dimensional coefficients are computed within the blocks <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="aeromod.htm">Aeromod</A></FONT></I> and <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="engmod.htm">Engmod</A></FONT></I>.)

<H3>Parameters which must be loaded in the M<SMALL>ATLAB</SMALL> Workspace</H3>

<UL>
<LI><I>GM1</I>: vector with some important geometrical properties of the 'Beaver' aircraft, and the mass of the aircraft (which is assumed to be constant during the motions of interest). Here, the wing span <I>b</I>, mean aerodynamic chord <I>cbar</I>, and wing area <I>S</I> are extracted from <I>GM1</I>. <I>GM1</I> can be loaded into the workspace from file by running the utility <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="loader.htm">LOADER</A></FONT></I>. Run <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="modbuild.htm">MODBUILD</A></FONT></I> first if the datafile does not exist.
