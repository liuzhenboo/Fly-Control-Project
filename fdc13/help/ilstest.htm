The masked subsystem block <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">ILStest</FONT></I>, from the ILS sublibrary of the block-library <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="navlib.htm">NAVLIB</A></FONT></I>, is called from within the masked S<SMALL>IMULINK</SMALL> block ILS, in order to check whether or not the localizer and glideslope signals are valid at the current aircraft position. The block ILStest is called from within the block <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif"><A HREF="ils.htm">ILS (Nominal ILS values)</A></FONT></I>. See the <A HREF="#References">references</A> for more information about <I><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Arial","Helvetica","Sans Serif">ILStest</FONT></I>.

<PRE>  yils4 = [LOCflag GSflag]'.
</PRE>
<B>Note:</B> <I>GSflag = 0</I> if aircraft is in area where glideslope signals can be received with appropriate accuracy; <I>LOCflag = 0</I> if the aircraft flies in area where the localizer signals are receivable. If the aircraft is too far away, <I>GSflag</I> and/or <I>LOCflag</I> are set to 1!
